# The Spoken World
An interactive worldwide map of place name pronunciations.

## MAPPING PROJECT PROPOSAL

**Introduction**

The inspiration to design and create a map that allows users to click on a place in the world and hear its pronunciation came to me in the form a 10-year-old's homework assignment. My cousin Asher had a geography project due for school, and he chose to author a report on Iceland. I had traveled to Iceland a few years prior, so his mother asked me one night if I could help him with the pronunciations of Icelandic cities.

And I could not!

This problem stuck with me for a few days, until finally the idea to make a map to help Asher came to mind.
